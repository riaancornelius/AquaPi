# AquaPi
This will eventually be a tropical aquarium controller created in Kivy.

I know nothing about Kivy, so this is my way of experimenting with it.

# Features

Right now, the planned features is:

* Display water temps in tank and sump using 2 waterproof DS18B20 sensors.
* Display flow raates into and out of the tank. Still deciding which sensors.
* Control lighting. Will probably control 3 relays switching 3 dual tube lighting units.
* Measure light levels (at least 2 points in the tank). Still deciding which sensors.
* Display water level alarms for sump too low or tank too full.
* Display CO2 status (on or off).

Later, I will probably add functionality to text me with any alarms.
